                        fantastic time exploring the area again. Robs food was delicious and highly
                        recommended. Sara enjoyed all the books and toys in the beach hut, the swings
                        and of course playing with Maisie! Hope to return soon it certainly is a home
                        from home.

                    delicious. We loved collecting eggs and now want chickens too! We also loved
                    playing with Maisie. What a lovely place to have a holiday. Harvey has also had

                    year, and indeed came back at the same time as us. The cottage and peaceful
                    location are lovely and the hospitality is wonderful. We were told not to
                    bring much for the children as everything would be here for them and that
                    was true! the children hardly played with any of their own toys! They loved
                    playing with Maisie aswell. Great holiday and would love to come back again.

                    We had a lovely week in Cornflower Cottage and echo all the previous comments-
                    Cornflower Cottage is a lovely, cosy home from home cottage and we felt happy
                    and settled in as soon as we arrived! The effort that Gwen, Alan and Rob put
                    into ensure that guests enjoy their stay has really made a difference to our
                    holiday. From the welcoming touches in the cottage - yummy welsh cakes, squash,
                    tea, milk on arrival, fluffy towels and comfy beds,, to a wonderful toy barn
                    which the boys loved and the amazing meals cooked by Rob. Not to forget,
                    the sheep, chickens and our boys new best friend Maisy

                    We were told a relaxing holiday with two small children wasn&#39;t possible - not
                    true. A day filled with sea air, visiting the many many attractions nearby
                    topped off with playing in the beach hut...what more could a little person want?

                    We have had a wonderful week here in Cornflower. The cottage is lovely and has
                    so many thoughtful touches The welcome from gwen, Alan , Rob and Maisy has been
                    nothing short of perfect. Our son has loved playing with Maisy, helping plant
                    seeds, feeding the lambs.
                </p>

                    The beach hut is a fantastic idea for adults and children alike. Rob&#39;s cooking
                    is excellent.&nbsp; Thank you.

                    A perfect place for a family reunion. All three cottages truly felt like a home
                    from home as soon as we walked through the door.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Real Christmas trees and all the cottages decorated superbly and made for a
                    wonderful festive atmosphere. Rob&#39;s delicious hearty meals kept everything
                    feeling cosy. Wonderful walks along Pembrokeshire many beautiful beaches.
                    Wrapped up warm and walking through the fields with children, dogs, sheep and
                    cats following. Wonderful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back home to our cottages with the many board games, puzzles and books
                    kept everyone entertained. The twinkly lights around all the cottages made
                    Meadow Green farm very magical. Thank you. See you in 2013
